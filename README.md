# Air Quality Monitor bicycle mount

These parts are designed to help mount an Air Quality Monitor to your bicycle.  They are specifically designed for the Dylos DC1700 being used by Environment Hamilton for their [Bicycle Air Monitoring project](http://www.environmenthamilton.org/view/page/BAM).

Mounting to a bicycle requires at least two of the given parts (a clip and a mount), plus some collection of fasteners.  The clip is designed to snap around the monitor, and the mounts allow it to be attached to different areas on the bike.

## Fasteners

If using the clip with the handlebar mount, you will need:

* 1 M5 bolt, socket head, 12mm-14mm long
* 1 M5 hex nut
* 1 M3 bolt, any head (thumbscrew preferred), 30mm or longer
* 1 M3 hex nut (or wing nut combined with hex head bolt)

If using the clip with the bottle hole mount (designed to attach to the braze-ons that are typically used to hole water bottle cages) you will need:

* 1 M5 bolt, socket head, 30mm-65mm long
* 1 M5 hex nut
* 2 M5 bolts of proper length for your braze-ons (probably included with your bike)
