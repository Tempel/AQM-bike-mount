**Do not edit these files**

These STL files are generated from the FCSTD files in the folder above this.
If you wish to modify anything in them, you should do so from the FCSTD file in
FreeCAD, and re-export the STL.  These files are included in this repository
solely to make it easier for others to use them without access to FreeCAD.
